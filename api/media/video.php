// ================================================================
//  CANAOPTICALCLINIC — api/media/video.php
//  Serves a video file with real HTTP Range Request support (206 Partial
//  Content). This exists because PHP's built-in dev server (php -S, what
//  this app's Railway deployment runs — see nixpacks.toml) does NOT honor
//  Range headers for static files at all: it always returns the whole
//  file with 200 OK regardless of what Range was requested. Without Range
//  support, a browser can't seek to an arbitrary timestamp — dragging the
//  scrubber or tapping skip ±10s either does nothing, hangs re-downloading
//  the whole file, or resets to the start. Works fine on Apache (localhost
//  via XAMPP), which supports Range natively for static files, which is
//  why this only ever showed up on the hosted deployment.
//
//  Public — the clinic video is shown on the pre-login landing page, same
//  as when it was served as a plain static file.
//
//  GET ?src=<filename inside assets/videos/>
// ================================================================

// Explicit rather than relying on whatever the host's default happens to
// be — makes sure a disconnected client (e.g. one that just abandoned this
// response for a new seek) actually terminates the script instead of
// running to completion regardless, which is what the connection_aborted()
// check further down depends on.

// buffering and after every seek — so responding to that literally (stream
// all the way to end-of-file) meant a single request could tie up the
// *entire* server for the rest of the video's duration. Tapping skip then
// had to wait for that still-running response to finish before the new
// seek's request could even start, which is exactly the delay this app saw
// only on the hosted deployment (localhost's Apache is multi-threaded, so
